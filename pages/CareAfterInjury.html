          <p>
            After getting diagnosed, your care team will recommend a specific
            treatment plan. It's important to know that
            <span class="font-semibold">
              the recovery process after peripheral nerve injury will look
              different for everyone</span

            of recovery that is possible will be different.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important to discuss your
            <span class="font-semibold">goals for recovery</span> with your care
            team. Based on your conversation, they will be able to present you
            with the treatment options that are the best fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lots of things are uncertain during this time, and it can feel
            frustrating to not know what is going to happen in the future. While
            your care team may not have all the answers, they are here to listen
            to your concerns and answer any questions you may have.

            <h3>Spontaneous Recovery</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes, nerves can naturally regrow after being injured. This
              is called <span class="font-semibold">spontaneous recovery</span>.
              Axons of neurons can regenerate at a rate of about 1mm/day if they
              are not completely cut or seriously injured.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, this is not possible with all nerve injuries. Recovery will
              depend on the following factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p style="margin-bottom: -2px">
                  <span class="font-semibold">Severity of injury:</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Severe injuries cause more damage to the layers of the nerve.
                  This makes it harder for spontaneous recovery to occur.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p style="margin-bottom: -2px">
                  <span class="font-semibold">Location of injury:</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nerves need to regrow from the injury all the way back to the
                  muscle or skin. The further the site of injury is from the end
                  target, the longer it will take for the nerve to regrow.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p style="margin-bottom: -2px">
                  <span class="font-semibold">Presence of scar tissue:</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Scar tissue can block the path of the growing nerve. This
                  slows growth and makes it less likely that the nerve will
                  reach its end target.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p style="margin-bottom: -2px">
                  <span class="font-semibold">Aging:</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  As we get older, our body’s natural ability to heal and
                  recover from injury is slowed. This may impact the speed of
                  spontaneous recovery of the nerve.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Generally,
              <span class="font-semibold">
                spontaneous recovery is preferred over surgery and leads to
                better recovery</span
              >. But, if spontaneous recovery does not happen, it is best for
              surgery to occur within 3-6 months of injury for better recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this period of time, things might feel at a standstill.
              Your healthcare team will carefully monitor the injury during
              follow-up appointments to determine whether spontaneous recovery
              is occurring, or if surgical treatment is likely to provide better
              results.

              Surgery may be a good option if there is no evidence of
              spontaneous recovery within 6 months of injury. The optimal time
              for surgery is between 3-6 months post injury. The

                <p>
                  In primary nerve repair, the two ends of the nerves are
                  aligned and sutured back together through the epineurium.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The recovery for this surgery are the best when done as soon

                <h4>Nerve Graft</h4>
                <p>
                  Nerve grafts are done when primary nerve repair can’t be done,
                  such as if the two ends of the nerve are too far apart to join
                  back together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During a nerve graft surgery, the injured part of the nerve is
                  replaced with a section of nerve taken from another part of
                  the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This nerve is usually connected to the same muscle as many
                  other nerves so that even if it is removed, the muscle still
                  works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The section of the nerve is used to connect the two ends of
                  the injured nerve together.

                <h4>Nerve Transfer</h4>
                <p>
                  During a nerve transfer, doctors try to connect a nearby
                  working nerve to the muscle that isn't working. This working
                  nerve may be less important or innervate a muscle that already
                  has nerve connections. The working nerve is attached to the
                  injured end that is still connected to the target muscle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This surgery guides the neurons from the working nerve to
                  travel into the injured nerve to reinnervate the muscle.

              affecting you day-to day, you may be asked to complete
              questionnaires about your injury during your visit.

          <h2>Restoring Movement and Sensation</h2>
          <p>
            After surgeries like nerve grafts or nerve transfers, the connection
            between the nerves and muscles need to be reinforced. The muscle
            that was connected to the damaged nerve is now receiving signals
            from a different nerve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this swap, we will need to retrain our brain to create a
            new connection between the nerve and the muscle. Exercises that help
            with this are known as
            <span class="font-semibold"> sensorimotor re-education</span>.

            <div class="text-column">
              <p>This can include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>movement exercises that work the new muscle,</li>
                <li>
                  practicing being able to identify where you are being touched,
                </li>
                <li>
                  and feeling different surfaces or objects to practice telling
                  the difference between textures.

          <h3>Biofeedback</h3>
          <p>
            Electrical stimulation through a process known as
            <span class="font-semibold"> surface EMG biofeedback </span> can
            also help you regain muscle strength and control.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/placeholder169.png" alt="" />
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Small electrodes are placed on the weakened/injured muscles.
                These electrodes can detect the signals produced when the
                muscles activate.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When you try to use the muscle, these signals are detected and
                converted into a visual or audio indicator, like a graph, or a
                beep.
              </p>
              <p>
                After injury when the muscle is weak, you may not be able to
                feel it working. However this machine is able to pick up signals
                that show you that muscle is still being activated.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Seeing the feedback in real-time can help you practice
                reactivating the correct muscle until you can actually feel it
                working.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This also helps strengthen the connections between the new nerve and
            muscle, and rewire your brain into knowing how to contract the
            muscle with the new nerve.
