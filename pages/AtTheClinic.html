        <p>
          The peripheral nerve injury clinic brings together a team of
          healthcare specialists who are typically seen at different stages of
          treatment. By having them all in one place, your wait time is reduced
          and your care team stays fully up-to-date on your injury and treatment
          plan.
        </p>

        <p>
          At your appointment, you may see a few of these specialists depending
          on your specific concerns and where you are in your recovery. You
          might also be asked to complete diagnostic tests or functional
          assessments to better understand your injury, functional changes, or
          monitor your recovery progress.

                Once you've been diagnosed, a surgeon may talk to you if you

            Diagnostic tests help doctors understand the cause of pain or
            reduced function. They can also show how serious the nerve injury
            is. This information helps them choose the best treatment plan for
            you.

          <h2>Medical History and Physical Exam</h2>
          <p>
            Before conducting any tests, the doctor will ask you questions about
            your injury. They will also look at your medical history to see if
            there are any health problems that could impact treatment and
            recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The doctor will also check the injured area. You might be asked to
            do some simple movements to figure out which muscles and nerves have
            been affected.

          <h2>Medical Imaging</h2>
          <p>
            To help understand what structures are affected, you may be asked to
            do some imaging exams. These can include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>X-rays</li>
            <li>CT scans</li>

          <p>
            X-rays and CT scans both use a type of radiation that has a small
            risk of harming living tissue. This risk will increase with more
            exposures to radiation, however, the risk of developing cancer from
            this exposure is quite low. X-rays and CT scans are incredibly
            helpful tools for doctors to diagnose conditions to get you the care
            you need.

                  X-rays show images of structures inside the body, such as your
                  bones and organs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During an x-ray, radiation is passed through your body.
                  Tissues that absorb x-rays easily, such as bone, will appear
                  whiter on the x-ray. The final image is created from the
                  different amounts of radiation that reach the detector.

                <p>
                  X-rays can help doctors see

                  CT scans use stacked x-rays to create detailed,

                  through your body. With new machines, CT scans can be done
                  quite quickly, taking

                  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed
                  cross-sectional images of nerves and surrounding tissue.
                  Unlike CT scans, MRIs are good at getting detailed pictures of

                <p>
                  Instead of radiation, MRIs use radio waves and magnetic fields

                <p>
                  During an MRI, you will lay on a bed that moves through an MRI
                  machine. This machine acts like a giant magnet that sends
                  radio waves through your body. This scan can take
                  <span class="font-semibold"> up to an hour to complete</span>,

                  During an ultrasound, a device called a transducer is placed
                  over the skin. The transducer passes sound waves through the
                  body. Different tissues will reflect the sound waves in
                  different ways to show the location and shape of bones,
                  muscles, nerves, and more.

                  There are no known risks for getting an ultrasound, but sound
                  waves donâ€™t travel as well through the body, so the image may
                  not be as clear.

              Electrical signals sent by motor and sensory nerves are called
              action potentials. Normal action potentials have a specific wave
              appearance that can change with injury.

            <h3>Needle Electromyography (EMG)</h3>
            <p>
              Electromyography (pronounced: uh-leck-troh-migh-OG-ruh-fee) is a
              nerve test that measures the electrical activity of muscles and
              nerves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doctors can look at the appearance of action potentials or how
              often they occur. If something looks unusual, it might mean
              thereâ€™s a problem with the connection between the nerve and
              muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Needle electrodes are special, small needles that measure
              electrical signals. During needle electromyography, the needle
              electrode is inserted through the skin. You may be asked to stay
              still or gently contract your muscles.

            <h3>Nerve Conduction Study</h3>
            <p>
              A nerve conduction study measures the speed and strength of action
              potentials passing in a nerve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Surface electrodes are placed on your skin at different points. A
              brief, mild electric pulse will be sent through one electrode to
              the other. The size and speed of the signal can help identify the
              severity and type of nerve damage that has occurred.
