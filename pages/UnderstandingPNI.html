            <h3>What is a nerve?</h3>
            <p>
              Nerves help us sense and react to the world around us. We have
              nerves throughout our body, including our skin and organs, that
              communicate with our brain. Nerves act like telephone wires that
              carry signals to communicate between the body and the brain.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two main types of nerves.
              <span class="font-semibold">Sensory nerves</span> help you feel
              your environment, such as when you touch something hot like a
              stovetop. Sensory nerves will send that information to your brain,
              allowing you to register it as pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="font-semibold">Motor nerves</span> can activate your
              muscles, sometimes to respond to a sensation like pain. They will
              carry signals from your brain that tell your muscles to stop,
              continue, or start moving.
            </p>

                    There are several layers of organization within a nerve.
                    These layers of connective tissue are important because they
                    help doctors classify the severity of nerve injury.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each nerve is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue
                    called the <span class="font-semibold">epineurium</span>.
                    Within the nerve, you will find fat, blood vessels, and
                    smaller nerve bundles called
                    <span class="font-semibold">fascicles</span>.

                    Each fascicle is wrapped in their own protective layer of
                    connective tissue called the
                    <span class="font-semibold">perineurium</span>. A fascicle
                    is made up of bundles of nerve cells, called neurons.

                    <span class="font-semibold">Neurons</span> are the basic

                includes your brain and spinal cord. It sends signals to the

              <li>
                The <span class="font-semibold">peripheral nervous system</span>

              When peripheral nerve injury occurs, this means nerves in the

            <h3>What is peripheral nerve injury?</h3>
            <p>
              Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) can affect your muscles or ability
              to feel sensations. Some common symptoms of PNI are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>muscle weakness,</li>
              <li>tingling/numbness,</li>
              <li>or pain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Every patient will have the different symptoms because each injury
              is different. How serious the injury is, where it happens, and how
              much of the nerve is damaged can change how a person's muscles or
              senses are affected.

            <h3>How are nerves in the arm organized?</h3>
            <p>
              On both sides of the body, a complex network of nerves called the
              <span class="font-semibold">brachial plexus</span> is located near
              the collarbone. The brachial plexus connects nerves from the
              spinal cord to the nerves in the arm.
            </p>
            <p>
              The nerves from the brachial plexus are responsible for arm
              <span class="font-semibold">sensation and movement</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because nerve connections are continuous from your spinal cord to
              your fingers, any injury that breaks or disrupts nerve connections
              will impact nerve function.

                      Starting from the neck and moving towards your hand, the
                      brachial plexus is organized into sections called
                      <span class="font-semibold"

                    <p>
                      Like branches on a tree, the nerves of the brachial plexus
                      split and recombine into different sections until becoming
                      the terminal nerves, which are the last major nerve
                      branches.

                    <p>

                    <p>
                      Each trunk splits into

                      that go to the front and back of the arm respectively.
                      There is an anterior and posterior division for the upper,
                      middle, and lower trunk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Further down, the divisions recombine to form three new

            <p>
              Most nerves will control a mix of sensation and muscle movement.
              Nerves that control sensation will carry signals from the skin to
              the brain, while nerves that control movement will carry signals
              from the brain to the muscles.

            <h3>What happens when nerves in the arm are damaged?</h3>
            <p>
              Any nerve or combination of nerves may be damaged in peripheral
              nerve injury. Terminal nerves can be individually damaged and also
              require surgical treatment. Generally, when the injury is closer
              to the spinal cord, more of the arm will be affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you feel pain, tingling, or numbness in your arm, this means
              that nerves involved in
              <span class="font-semibold">sensation</span> are injured.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your arm feels weaker or muscles look smaller, this means that
              nerves involved in <span class="font-semibold">movement</span> are

            <h3>Brachial Plexus Injury</h3>
            <p>
              Brachial plexus injury can be more severe and complex because the
              brachial plexus is closer to the spinal cord. This means that many
              arm functions or sensations may be impacted.
            </p>
            <h4>Location</h4>
            <p>
              Because the brachial plexus is close to the collarbone, brachial
              plexus injury can be described based whether they occur above,
              behind, or below the collarbone.

            <h4>Area of Brachial Plexus</h4>
            <p>
              Brachial plexus injuries can also be categorized by whether the
              upper, middle, or lower trunk is involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="font-semibold">Upper Trunk Injury:</span> Nerves that
              make up the upper trunk send signals to the upper area of the arm
              and shoulder.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Sensory symptoms:</span> Upper trunk
                injury can cause loss of feeling or numbness in the shoulder,
                outside of arm, and thumb.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Motor symptoms:</span> You may also
                be unable to lift your arm at the shoulder, bend your arm at the
                elbow, or feel like your arm is weak in general. In extreme
                cases, paralysis of shoulder muscles and biceps can occur.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span class="font-semibold">Middle Trunk Injury:</span> Injury to
              the middle trunk can affect some
              <span class="font-semibold">wrist and forearm muscles</span>.
              However, the middle trunk is rarely injured on its own because of
              its location. When it is injured, it is usually along with other
              parts of the brachial plexus.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="font-semibold">Lower Trunk Injury:</span> When the
              lower trunk alone is injured, strength in the shoulder and elbow
              are usually preserved, but
              <span class="font-semibold">hand function is affected</span>.
